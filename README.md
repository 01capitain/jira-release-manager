No idea yet what category this falls into, I want to experiment with it and find good resources for learning..

### Authorization

#### Discord oAuth

Find how to set up discord OAuth in the [First steps on t3.gg](https://create.t3.gg/en/usage/first-steps). _Caveat:_ The OAuth callback is set up to redirect to localhost:3000
If that port is changed you need to also update the webhook within the [Discord setup](https://discord.com/developers/applications/1411074365621145772/oauth2).
