# Goal
Have a script that manages the Jira Releases of the jira clout instance you give it access to.
It will communicate via Jira REST API to fetch information about releases and issues.
After that it will enrich the releases to give it semantics of type of release, gives the option to release releases and create follow up releases after releasing a version.
Also it can check the consitency of jira issues.
