The goal is to review the code changes in the repository.
On the one hand this will increase the quality of the code base, on the other hand it will showcase whether CodeRabbit might be suitable for a broader use within a corporate environment.

## Features
![[Graphite - pricing.png]]

The free tier does not allow us to use the AI-powered PR (feature called [Diamond](https://graphite.dev/docs/diamond)) is not active.
I would love to see the quality of the merge requests, but we use CodeRabbit for it for now. 

### Dashboard
Instead, we have a [dashboard](https://app.graphite.dev/) to see the current status of the merge requexts and issues in the github repository.
