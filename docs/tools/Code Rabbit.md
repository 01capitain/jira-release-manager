We are introducing Code Rabbit to Github.
The goal is to review the code changes in the repository.
On the one hand this will increase the quality of the code base, on the other hand it will showcase whether CodeRabbit might be suitable for a broader use within a corporate environment.!

## Features

The free tier allows to summarize PR summaries and gives a Review in the IDE.
We connected the github repository to have it in action.
