# Database Entity Conventions

To ensure consistency and maintainability across our database schema, all entities must adhere to the following conventions.

## Required Columns

Every entity must include the following columns:

*   `id`: A UUID v7 that serves as the unique primary key. This ID must be generated by the database itself (e.g., using a function like `uuid_generate_v7()`), not by the application service level.
*   `created_at`: A timestamp marking when the record was created. This should be set by the database automatically.
*   `updated_at`: A timestamp marking the last time the record was updated. This should be updated by the database automatically on any change.

## Discouraged Data Types

### Booleans

Boolean fields (e.g., `isActive`, `isDeleted`) should be avoided. Instead of a boolean, consider using a timestamp or a status enum that can represent more states than just true/false. For example:

*   Instead of `is_deleted`, use a `deleted_at` timestamp. The presence of a timestamp indicates deletion.
*   Instead of `is_active`, use a `status` field that can hold values like `active`, `inactive`, `archived`, etc.

This approach provides more context and flexibility for future requirements.
